In short terms the explanation of karma is that everything happens with a reason and we are all responsible for the things that we make.

Many people believe in this even though it is not accepted as general truth…but let's start from the beginning.\r\n\r\nCheryl is an expert in paranormal activities. Nicole has called her because she was simply terrified by something that happened in her house, actually by the condition of her house. Nicole accidently has found out that her grandfather many years ago has hidden somewhere in the house golden coins with a great value.

Even though the circumstances are same in general, the national parks function in more controlled conditions. There are persons who are responsible for the animals and the wild life in the national park. They take care everything to be ok, all animals to be fed and get enough water but also they take care the park to be clean all the time. \r\n\r\nKent works as a ranger in the national park Silver Pine. Every winter he has a job to provide the animals suitable conditions and food for the wild animals that live in the park. Every morning in winter Kent gives food to the wild animal. You may say that they are wild animals so they could find food for themselves easily, but the fact is that in winter this could be little bit hard. Kent makes their life easier, by providing them with food and everything that is necessary for them to survive under those hard circumstances.\r\n\r\nNow let's take a walk together with Kent and see all the beauties of this amazing national park. We will definitely see many things that are not part of our everyday lives in this park and learn something more about the wild animals that live there.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PJXTWB75MFB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Midnight Calling: Wise Dragon","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64942.14273488422598723.15aa9856-7eb8-48b1-8321-0db52f6ef080.301bbadf-4a72-4319-a9c2-93955b167692","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4268.14273488422598723.15aa9856-7eb8-48b1-8321-0db52f6ef080.cbebbef0-9170-4c68-ba80-0b2a97062a0e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9932.14273488422598723.b133170c-f81d-4731-a8cd-c0186f008a6d.28ca5447-f005-4298-a6d5-df93e9d69b15","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9718.14273488422598723.b133170c-f81d-4731-a8cd-c0186f008a6d.7037ed72-5e5c-42f7-a374-5d45adb6cbca","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $12.79","Price":12.79,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["BigFishGames.MidnightCallingWiseDragon_bsrvrvej7yy2w"],"ContentIds":["512920ec-b7e1-da56-0387-861c33358cee"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Elephant Games brings you a thrilling new adventure in Midnight Calling: Wise Dragon! \r\n\r\nA letter from your father leads you to your hometown.

Restore the balance between Light and Darkness! Build towers and traps using technologies of Orcs, Goblins and Necromancers.\r\nShow your tactical skills combining various towers' effects and using terrain features. Protect the stronghold of the Dark Forces from the onslaught of hostile armies of Light!\r\n\r\nNOTICE: If you have problems running the game please contact us (and please specify your device model): wp7.smartpixgames@gmail.com\r\nFAQ: http://www.smartpixgames.com/faq.php#p10\r\nPromo video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRz9-Zf0flk\r\n\r\nIn the full version of Myth Defense: Dark Forces:\r\n- 4 maps + random map in battle mode\r\n- campaign: 10 + 50 missions and 2 modes to pass it: Normal and Heroic\r\n- achievements, increasing amount of Glory Points for mission\r\n- different skills improvement \r\n- 22 types of towers and 3 types of traps in 3 technological branches (Orcs, Necromancers, Goblins)\r\n- special features of monsters and towers\r\n- runes to make towers stronger, and Alchemy to create runes\r\n- terrain features: difficult terrain, moving platforms, etc.\r\n- 40 levels of hardness. The higher the level, the greater the reward\r\n- multilingual interface\r\n- original panoramic sound and music\r\n- additional DLC maps and campaigns with new enemies and towers\r\n- online worldwide leaderboards\r\n\r\nWe hope that Light Forces commanders, who loved the first part of Myth Defense, will be pleasantly surprised by the innovations in this part:\r\n• Enemies are now divided into classes: Live, Machine and Magic. Some towers affects only units of one class.\r\n• Moving platforms on the battlefield where you can build towers. Platform with a tower will move as close as possible to enemy units and attack them.\r\n• Some units (Dwarf and Paladin) wear armor. Armor absorbs 80% of low physical damage. Armor threshold is shown in the unit description which you can see by tapping on an enemy unit on the field. If tower causes more physical damage than the armor threshold, the armor breaks down and the unit gets full damage value. Armor doesn't protect units from other types of damage (fire , magic, etc)\r\n• Several fundamentally new towers:\r\n  - Fear Tower: scares enemy units, forcing them to run away from the tower for a while. One enemy can be scared only once (though some units are fearless).\r\n  - Cursed Tower: normally it shoots causing a base damage but can be charged with coins to temporarily multiply its power. If the health of the enemy unit does not exceed the base damage, the tower will kill it without spending extra-points. If the unit is strong tower will try to kill it, spending no more than enough extra-points.\r\n  - Jet Mace: shoots with a large spiked ball horizontally or vertically. It strikes several enemy units losing some destructive power each time. The ball continues to fly until it loses all the energy.\r\n  - Radioactive towers (Uranium and Plutonium): do not shoot, but continuously irradiates all units within damage radius. Golems and infected (by Plague or Poison Spider Tower) units are vulnerable to radiation.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDD39P","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Doodle Devil","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20242.9007199266374280.6917f863-bc73-454a-bf6f-02fc062972b3.aa1b1a28-2c05-4fb4-ba41-48e91c65ecc3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0071eb","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30326.9007199266374280.b088f2a2-179b-4084-be9d-7ae2eda8c39e.abef7353-df96-4db5-836f-2c62601ddafd","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0071eb","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9338.9007199266374280.b8e9cce9-5119-4263-9438-bd2aeb6afc44.056f1bab-39e3-40be-b251-5a4d7831ad67","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0071eb","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $0.59⁺","Price":0.59,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["JoyBitsLtd.DoodleDevil_2687mb06qk6xe"],"ContentIds":["e365e18f-0a3e-8148-3433-36415c0552a1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Great Halloween Sale! 50% off all in-app purchases!\r\n\r\nTrick or Treat!\r\nHappy Halloween from JoyBits!

The British sent an expeditionary force to retake the islands. \r\n\r\nIn Submarine Patrol, you will relive this era as a leader of a submarine that patrols the islands and destroys enemy battleships.   \r\n\r\nTarget well before you shoot! Remember, you have a limited number of torpedoes on board. You cannot immediately fire one torpedo after another. \r\n\r\nIt takes 2-3 seconds to prepare the next torpedo. Injured ships, depending on the amount of damage, may reduce their speed and move slower. \r\n\r\nDepending on the ship type, you can hit it 1 to 4 times before it is completely destroyed. You have 10 levels to complete. If you do well you will be promoted to commander, captain, or even an admiral. The quality of shooting is determined by your score. You score with every successful shot and you are fined with every missed torpedo.  \r\n\r\nPlease, check our website for tips and tricks on the game here: http://pepper-games.com","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDFRT9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Enigmatis 2: The Mists of Ravenwood (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26291.9007199266299116.d023f759-0a0d-483b-8cb5-d6720e2d27a3.f7dae87e-891d-40ca-9afb-f4cc97e52cb4","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $8.99","Price":8.99,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"107","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.Enigmatis2TheMistsofRavenwoodFull_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["4e028590-bb44-06af-25dc-00b294284170","cfa1e91e-2d81-4272-637e-b040adf12aae"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nEnigmatis: The Mists of Ravenwood is the sequel to the smash hit Enigmatis: The Ghost of Maple Creek. It is a detective story rich with horror, plot twists, and shadowy intrigue.\r\n\r\nA year has passed since the events of Maple Creek. But for the past few months, our detective has been hot on the trail of the demonic preacher she fought one year ago. Yet he has managed to always stay one step ahead. \r\n\r\nShe hoped to bring an end to the chase in the redwood forests of Northern California. But like so many times before, the trail went cold… \r\n\r\nThen she encountered an abandoned camper in the middle of the highway. Enormous claw marks scored the roof and the lost family’s personal belongings were scattered everywhere. All signs pointed to the scene being fresh. \r\n\r\nAnd all clues led into nearby Ravenwood Park…\r\n\r\nWalking through the park gates, the detective feels the weight of invisible eyes watching. Sinister shadows lurk behind the park’s enchanting scenery and the wary glances of its overly-polite employees. Is this place connected to Maple Creek, and the preacher? \r\n\r\nWho is the mysterious prisoner she meets on the forest path – someone stalking her every move, or a possible ally? Is she merely a puppet being used in forces from outside our world, or will she finally resolve the evil events that began one year before?","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDFZQV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Kids Learn to Read (Preschool)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48584.9007199266294589.069a6d75-161e-4a80-a739-3fd0d6456417.91ebdc6b-1ca8-4501-95dd-782bcac68000","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14788.9007199266294589.2d721035-59b2-43b6-bca7-02a9c46d6463.9c3b5ba3-c761-403a-ac97-94d612ab597f","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26880.9007199266294589.610920b5-ed90-4719-8b1f-82e13a50158c.28e2137f-7e39-4d56-8657-916ef0913e12","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33380.9007199266294589.72f926ad-2fbf-446d-977f-8ad4576275c4.b50c42ac-f964-4f4d-972e-03f5b6d216f3","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#2b5666","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $3.89","Price":3.89,"AverageRating":4.1,"RatingsCount":"10","PackageFamilyNames":["Intellijoy.KidsLearntoReadPreschool_aeskzhp7pykjg"],"ContentIds":["924434b6-eb68-f854-4485-a3e526eebbd0","80b78112-4632-042c-5ce2-d6c83b76bf70","67488c98-f2da-e508-d366-8df18e8a0644","11c9abba-7f9b-5b48-8495-12c1868248a6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Kids Learn to Read is the latest child-pleasing addition to Intellijoy's best-selling reading curriculum series, and is preceded by Kids ABC Letters and Kids ABC Phonics.\r\n\r\nKids Learn to Read is a delightful game that invites preschool-aged children to practice blending sounds together to read and spell simple words, such as \"dog\", \"sun\", and \"big\".\r\nIts six sections include:\r\n\r\n- In Magic Letter Bridge kids learn to blend letter sounds into words by moving Tommy the Turtle across the letter bridge as each letter is sounded out and a word is formed and pronounced.

Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child's developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThe educational flashcards for tots are divided into the following categories: berries, fruits, vegetables, flowers, mushrooms, the environment (sea, island, forest, river, mountain, etc.), the seasons, and natural phenomena (rain, rainbow, sunset, lightning, etc.). \r\n\r\nOne important feature makes this educational app stand out from the rest: instead of drawings, which are not always easy to identify, the child will see beautiful, colorful photographs of each object and phenomenon. \r\n\r\nClearly, it is not so easy to show real live lightning, rainbow or erupting volcano to a child. This educational app allows the child to “see” many natural objects and phenomena as they appear in reality, while allowing parents to tell the child more about them. \r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! Besides English, this app also supports the German, Russian and Ukrainian languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their foreign language teachers and classmates. An A+ is sure to follow! \r\n\r\nIn order to use this educational app, the youngster does not need to be able to read. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently!\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDSQZX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Mystery of Mortlake Mansion","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45120.9007199266593757.e89bb952-e8e7-40c0-9e70-e22232b81847.68c3e8b9-8f89-4048-b619-56305e78e803","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $5.29","Price":5.29,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["DEC51CE9.MysteryofMortlakeMansion_hqy437j5mvrh0"],"ContentIds":["45e94024-4d5f-3fec-6608-9e2fb801911c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Accept challenge in the adventure Mystery of Mortlake Mansion Full version and stop the evil in this hidden object game.\r\n   The old Mortlake Mansion is living a mysterious double life.

is a brand-new title from the creators of This War of Mine. It’s a society survival game that asks what people are capable of when pushed to the brink of extinction. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. The city’s ruler has to manage both the citizens and the infrastructure they live in. The leader’s tactical skills face challenges that will frequently question morality and the basic foundations of what we consider organized society. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.\r\n\r\nWhat decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And...\r\n\r\n...who will you become in the process?\r\n\r\nMAKE THE LAW\r\nSociety is a group of people who abide by the same rules and share similar beliefs. Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.\r\n\r\nWEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES\r\nSome of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.\r\n\r\nDEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES\r\nSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE THE FROSTLAND\r\nWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.\r\n\r\nSHAPE YOUR SOCIETY\r\nIf you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back.\r\n\r\nGO BEYOND THE CAMPAIGN\r\nThe main story campaign can go different ways depending on your playstyle, but it is still not the only challenge to tackle. Frostpunk offers different scenarios and additional updates with new content will be added in the future.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDFVSG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Defense zone 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.32001.9007199266293401.7a9551cc-9a07-4da5-bd71-606e3ae9e784.c2ca721e-15fc-4ae2-aebe-7b50b370b650","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.60055.9007199266293401.7b6d0362-1f79-4d2e-81ed-96d1175a0f6a.c51a68cc-86ba-4108-b71e-7f3b2439510d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47957.9007199266293401.a95e7d0a-d0d3-4cdc-8341-c8134b7dd67a.e5a6a57d-1384-49d7-9882-370f4a53f2d3","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $3.89","Price":3.89,"AverageRating":4.6,"RatingsCount":"15","PackageFamilyNames":["10991ArtemKotov.Defensezone2_6acec3smeeeap"],"ContentIds":["762d3252-3763-ae89-80ab-15bf029ddfeb","3fe124bb-4363-c402-a905-d16097a4dcb3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The new, engaging levels are even more stunning and impressive.

Beautiful flowers make them feel the joys of spring, and the painting process turns into an enthralling game where they can bring their fantasies to life and draw a red daffodil, or a blue sunflower.\n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

on the face of the planet. These amazing animals boggle our imagination by their variety and size. Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Today, archaeologists study the remains of these animals and can only assume how they looked and lived.  \n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

There are also challenges and obstacles to overcome, so don’t think that finding the answer is all you need to accomplish. \r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PM4JCC6L6LK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"ACA NEOGEO SAMURAI SHODOWN II","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44612.14305194381755922.7cb7d360-e13c-4e03-bbbc-344352aff244.32c5489a-4cba-4f97-acc1-751330d47d05","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14130.14305194381755922.7cb7d360-e13c-4e03-bbbc-344352aff244.fb80fa0e-0f9e-4f00-805a-dac9c4336389","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43385.14305194381755922.7cb7d360-e13c-4e03-bbbc-344352aff244.ec03288e-8255-48b6-ac7a-072195ee9a46","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7297.14305194381755922.7cb7d360-e13c-4e03-bbbc-344352aff244.96677e00-f63d-42c1-9276-4882740a556e","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4129.14305194381755922.7cb7d360-e13c-4e03-bbbc-344352aff244.deca24f8-95d6-43ec-be04-bfc847ab16a3","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $10.99","Price":10.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["HAMSTERCorporation.ACANEOGEOSAMURAISHODOWNII_7xd3265gdqs6r"],"ContentIds":["c6f513f8-42b0-8870-cf35-7686d4d1a845"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"SAMURAI SHODOWN II is a fighting game released by SNK in 1994. \r\nThe legendary weapon-wielding fighting game returns stronger / sharper than ever! \r\nFour newcomers join the battle for a total of 15 combatants ready to step on the stage of grand battles. \r\nWith the new Rage System and Weapon Breaking Attacks, epic and intense battles are waiting for you!\r\n\r\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces.\r\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time.

Whilst AI has suddenly become fashionable the 2019 edition celebrates 16 years of ZingMagic bringing you the best in artificial intelligence based board, card and puzzle games, and over 35 years of Bridge products, starting with the Bridge Challenger. \r\n\r\nOmar Sharif Bridge supports 2 variants of the card game of Bridge: Rubber and Chicago (Four-deal) Bridge.\r\n\r\nBridge is played by four players who form two partnerships. Players within a partnership face each other across a table. Traditionally, the players are referred to by the points of the compass - North, East, South and West.

Plan is a puzzle adventure game that takes place entirely inside an elevator. Go floor to floor, find items, and meet a bizarre cast of characters. Discover relationships between different things in the building and unlock its secrets. \r\n\r\nIt's the most fun you can have while stuck in an elevator.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\nElevator-Scale VR\r\nFloor Plan: Hands-On Edition adds full support for motion controllers to the original game. Walk around the elevator, grab things, and press buttons! Or if you'd rather enjoy your buttons from a distance, you can play seated or standing with a variety of control options. \r\n\r\nClassic Genre, New Paint\r\nFloor Plan takes mechanics from your favorite classic point-and-click adventure games and reimagines them for first person VR.

Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child’s developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThe educational flashcards for kids are divided into the following categories: “Cars and Transport”, “Professions”, “Buildings”, “Musical Instruments”, “Tools”, “Furniture”, “Kitchen Tools” and “Clothing and shoes”. \r\n\r\nOne important distinction makes this educational app stand out from the rest: instead of drawings, which are not always easy to identify as a real object, the child will see bright, beautiful and fun-spirited photographs. This will allow the child to “see” each object as it actually appears in the real world, while allowing the parent to tell the child more about this object.\r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! In addition to English, this app also supports the Spanish, German and many other languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with the educational flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their teachers and classmates. An A+ is guaranteed!\r\n\r\nThe youngster does not need to be able to read in order to use this educational app. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently. \r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

However, certain entities in the Energy Realm have evolved into matter-less sentient beings. The game’s kitten protagonist (a cat-shaped energy entity) and spirits are all examples of such beings. Pure energy entities can travel freely between the two realms.\r\n\r\nThe story of WENJIA thus unfolds…\r\n\r\nA forest’s longstanding tranquility is shattered by a sudden earthquake. As lava bursts forth from the ground, the mountain’s spirits find themselves surrounded by fiery death. By controlling a kitten, the player must overcome numerous obstacles in the wild to reach the burning heart of the mountain and rescue the spirits before it’s too late.\r\n\r\nCross-Realm Travels\r\n\r\nWENJIA is a 2D platform game with puzzle-solving elements. Players can freely travel between two realms, each of them with different challenges and obstacles.
