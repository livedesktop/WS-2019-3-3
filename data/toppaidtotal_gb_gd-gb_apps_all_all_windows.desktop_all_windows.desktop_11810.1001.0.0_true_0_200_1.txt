Almost all issues are trivial and can be solved right away. We usually answer within 24 hours.\r\n\r\nSpeechToText Pro is a professional speech-to-text app designed for generating longer pieces of content. Create articles, essays, even ebooks, only using Voice Typing. Never again touch the mouse and keyboard, or touchscreen, when using this speech-to-text software!\r\n\r\nAlthough it is 100% accurate most of the time, its real power lies in the flexible voice commands - referred to as Actions - that let you control all aspects of text presentation. Use them to make any correction or change the presentation of any segment of text.\r\n\r\nSome of the Actions are... Select, Select From/Until, Select Last Word, Select Last Sentence, Select Previous, Select Next, Insert Before, Insert After, Delete, Delete Last Word, Delete Last Sentence, Capitalize, Uppercase, Lowercase, Round Bracket, Double Quote, Single Quote, Hyphenate, Join, Reverse, Acronymize, Spell, and more. You can also create bulleted lists easilty. Usage of Actions and all other features is illustrated by example in video tutorials, accessible from inside the app. There is also a user guide on Actions that can be printed and downloaded.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this description - as is - was voice typed using SpeechToText Pro and Actions.\r\n\r\nSpeechToText Pro will not do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Work without internet.\r\n\r\n2. Produce good results without a high-quality USB microphone. (For more details, see Resources -> Best Results.)\r\n\r\n3. Produce accurate results in the presence of background noise.\r\n\r\n4. Transcribe speeches delivered from a distant source, such as a public speaker.\r\n\r\n5. Convert audio files into text.\r\n\r\n6. Produce audio recordings. This is strictly a speech-to-text app! (Well, it does text-to-speech as well.)\r\n\r\nHere is what SpeechToText Pro does. It:\r\n\r\n1) Converts spoken words into text at the rate of natural speech, and at near-100% accuracy.\r\n\r\n2) Lets you modify existing text, or define the presentation of the text you are pronouncing, through the use of voice commands. Voice commands replace the mouse and keyboard. However, the option to modify text using those methods exists too.\r\n\r\n3) Lets you substitute the predefined voice commands with your own.\r\n\r\n4) Offers support for hotkeys. Simply assign a voice command to a difficult-to-pronounce segment of text. Then pronounce the voice command for the difficult-to-pronounce text to print.\r\n\r\n5) Lets you save text, send it as an email, send it as an SMS message, share it to other apps, upload it to OneDrive, play it back in a synthetic voice, or print it.\r\n\r\n6) Makes it convenient to paraphrase spoken content in Youtube videos.\r\n\r\n7) Lets you do scientific calculator-level calculations with its voice-driven calculator.\r\n\r\n8) Helps you protect your content by defining users. \r\n\r\n9) Lets you produce richly formatted content that can be saved as an RTF file, PDF file, or printed.\r\n\r\n10) Works in English, Mandarin, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese & Spanish.  \r\n\r\nAlthough SpeechToText Pro has a learning curve, it is minimized thanks to its intuitive design, easy-to-read documentation, and the fact that every control (button, switch, menu) throughout the user interface is documented with a tooltip. Every major component of the app has its own user guide. The user guide on Actions can also be saved or printed. The information in the user guides is complemented by video tutorials, accessible through Resources -> Video Tutorials.\r\n\r\nIt is in the user's best interest to learn all the features of SpeechToText Pro so that this Windows 10 speech to text app can be used in its fullest potential.\r\n\r\nSpeechToText Pro has a free 24-hour trial period and then a price of $6.49. Positive reviews help this app continue improving. We also welcome user feedback! Many of the app's present features started out as feature requests. If there is a feature you would like to see implemented, please send an email to admin@hasfocus.com.

No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing the weapons of fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets. \r\n\r\nWith its unique, stylized graphics SUPERHOT finally adds something new and disruptive to the FPS genre. SUPERHOT’s polished, minimalist visual language helps you concentrate on the most important - on the fluidity of gameplay and cinematic beauty of the fight. \r\n\r\nSUPERHOT features: \r\n- Endless Mode - How long can you last against unyielding waves of enemies? \r\n- Challenge Mode - Take on SUPERHOT with your bare hands, no restarts, timed runs, and more. \r\n- Extras - Delve further into SUPERHOT with mini-games, ASCII art, and [redacted]. \r\n\r\nThirty months in the making. Thousands of hours put into development and design. From its humble origins in the 7 Day FPS game jam, through a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign to a plethora of awards and nominations from industry experts, SUPERHOT is a labor of love by its independent, dedicated team and thousands of backers from all around the globe.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NV6P5WFT5ML","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Master Adobe Indesign","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17465.14400209638088111.adb33968-3cac-40e3-90dd-ccf8fad7e417.869a0d87-a55a-40ed-8dbd-0e9a7051e589","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2675.14400209638088111.a528b767-3a6d-40d8-8681-abdae8535ed4.4ff53024-86fb-449d-8640-2a2c8b6c8374","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18285.14400209638088111.d3923b3c-9ddd-4e00-8e13-a1997f52b79f.9018fe34-6451-4175-b7c0-2fd13e471c26","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6273.14400209638088111.4d2bba47-4493-4f29-ae35-1b2e2a06023a.bc68ee24-c1b5-40f9-bdf8-251c05382219","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39096.14400209638088111.cc68c2a2-51c4-421f-ae26-6640a48f8682.8fcfeb3b-c011-4e85-971e-2392f5cc6e28","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4050.14400209638088111.44c1fe41-714e-4ce8-8e17-df8bd3624342.badc7c1e-7a8f-4af8-abcd-5e9ed58f5912","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£4.99","Price":4.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["8635ApproachApplications.MasterAdobeIndesign_jnpw9xmhc8mta"],"ContentIds":["49ac80bd-ec93-27e1-eafa-6e7ba04c6419"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Adobe InDesign is used to create works such as posters, flyers, brochures, magazines, newspapers, presentations, books and ebooks.\r\n\r\nThis collection of 500 plus video guides will soon get you up and running with Adobe InDesign.\r\n\r\nGetting the most out of it takes some doing and this app with it's 500 plus! easy to follow video lessons will help you do just that. \r\n\r\nUse this app as a “Video Referencing Library” where you can come back for a refresher lesson or search for how to do something new.\r\n\r\nApp Functionality\r\n** Edit the video title, subtitle and keep your own set of user notes.\r\n** Move the video around it's group and even change it's group.\r\n** Make videos your favourites and give them your own rating.\r\n** Search by title or notes. \r\n** View by favourites or rating.\r\n** View by history the last ten played or visited videos.\r\n\r\nLessons include:\r\nAdobe InDesign For Beginners -

Happy retro gaming!\r\n\r\nRocky Horror, The Fruit Machine can be played by touching the onscreen buttons (Or the corner game board icons, a real help for smaller screens) or by using a mouse-which covers most devices so happy retro gaming, all you need to provide is some real luck...\r\n\r\nTo add coins/credits to the fruit machine simply tap or click the red coin slot (Coin slot found at the top right of the fruit machine). Each tap/click of the coin slot will add four credits to the fruit machine, then just play the fruit machine like you normally would do. \r\n\r\nThe main features of Rocky Horror, The Fruit Machine include;\r\n\r\n-Trail Mystery Bonus Features-(When the trail is on number four you can select a random trail mystery bonus feature which may help you to either get a prize win or increase the trail number you are currently on, depending on the feature and most of the time they are a real help to the player. The mystery bonus features available include Random Rocket, Showskill, 3 Shot, Nudge, etc ...).\r\n\r\n-Trail Nudges, Nudge Gamble, Nudge Buster-(Trail nudges can be offered as a trail mystery bonus feature and are also offered randomly whilst playing the trail part of the fruit machine. When trail nudges are offered they are sometimes offered with a nudge gamble too and when you have trail nudges available you may use the nudge buster button to move all of the three main reels down one position at the cost of just one nudge, a real useful button indeed).\r\n\r\n-Hi-Lo Gamble-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you will be offered an optional prize/trail hi-lo gamble. Here you can either collect your prize, gamble with a hi-lo or possibly exchange to the game board if available. If you gamble and lose, you will lose the gambled prize/trail, if you gamble and win though you will improve your prize/trail by one position/slot and if you have an exchange to game board offer, then that offer may improve too. If you are lucky and get to the top of the prize/trail board you will automatically win the trail jackpot repeater).\r\n\r\n-Exchange To Game Board-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you may be offered an exchange to the game board. An exchange to the game board is offered when the tubes are lit in the tube slot next to the prize/trail amount you are currently on. When offered an exchange to game board amount, it will mirror the prize/trail slot you are currently on, the higher the slot, the better the game board exchange offer. The exchange offer may improve every time a hi-lo gamble is won, except on a trail jackpot repeater win).\r\n\r\n-Game Board/Tubes-(Once exchanged to the game board you can gamble and spin to try to add to or light up/activate the tubes or collect a tube if it’s active. The tubes consist of a cash tube, a grab tube, a nudge tube and a features tube which all offer different games and the higher the tube, the better.

The unique “sketch” mode allows single-click styling of any figure as if it is sketched by hand.\r\n\r\nYou can create basic shapes and connections very quickly thanks to the freehand drawing recognition. For complex drawings, there are hundreds of ready-to-use stencils on the toolbox that can be easily dragged to the canvas. Most of these stencils are not just static images, but complex objects with plenty of properties setting up their appearance and behavior in the designer.\r\n\r\nApplication was developed to take advantage of the entire set of devices from powerful workstations and top ultrabooks to hybrids and smallest tablets. It provides great user experience with all types of inputs – touch and pen, mouse and keyboard without sacrificing any editing capabilities of the desktop software.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Buy it once and use on all your Windows devices. You can save hundreds on separate licenses! ***\r\n\r\n\r\n Grapholite can be used for:\r\n• Flow charts;\r\n• Swimlanes;\r\n• Organizational charts;\r\n• Uml diagrams;\r\n• Web site structures and wireframes;\r\n• Application’s interface sketches (ui mockups);\r\n• Computer network layouts (including Cisco networks);\r\n• Floor plans (office layouts, building plans, home plans etc.);\r\n• Business process models (both bpmn 1.2 and bpmn 2.0 notations are supported);\r\n• Mind maps and brainstorming diagrams;\r\n• Venn charts and set charts;\r\n• Data flow diagrams;\r\n• Process flow diagrams;\r\n• Workflows;\r\n• Chevron and circular diagrams;\r\n• Swot analysis;\r\n• Scientific illustrations;\r\n• Graphs, algorithms, schemes;\r\n• Planograms;\r\n• Infographics.\r\n\r\nYou can start working on a diagram in the field using only touch and pen and finish the document in the office in the most comfortable environment with the help of habitual mouse and keyboard. On hybrid devices and productivity tablets such as Microsoft Surface you even won’t need to restart the application!\r\n\r\nThe app provides a unique set of shape behaviors for each diagram type. For example, windows and doors will automatically connect to walls in floor plans; shapes support automatic layout of children and collapsing\\expanding of the hierarchy levels in org charts and mind maps. Connections auto-routing logic also depends on the diagram type.\r\n\r\nObjects tree pane allows you to inspect, select, lock and hide all visual objects.\r\n\r\nPrint, share, export your diagrams and insert them in your web-sites, blog posts, publications, articles, documents, spreadsheets, presentations and other media.\r\n\r\nGrapholite supports export to Pdf, Png, Jpeg, Svg and Microsoft Visio (Vdx) formats. You can also import Microsoft Visio files from both Vdx and Vsdx (Visio 2013) formats. \r\n\r\nThe application is compatible with our Desktop, Windows Phone and Android versions.\r\n\r\nAn unlimited free trial will allow you to try all application features for free (you can’t save your work in trial).","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Builder is an excellent tool for Knowledge Management. You can save text documents and web pages with all formattings and links in your knowledge base and perform a full text search in it. Since every document is attached as a text note to a mindmap item, you can organize them perfectly in a large mindmap. This mindmap is browsable, so you will never lose perspective even with thousands of documents. All items are stored in a reliable local SQLite database. The app includes many other outstanding features such as the automatic creation of mindmaps from text documents, the import of Wikipedia articles and Twitter tweets into your mindmap and much more.

The next step is to adjust the picture by multi-touch gestures with your fingers (position, zoom and rotation).\r\n\r\nPhoto paper (cm): 9x13, 10x13, 10x15, 11x15, 13x18, single image (selected size)\r\n\r\nPhoto paper (inch): 3½x5¼, 4x5¼, 4x6, 4½x6, 5x7, single image (selected size)\r\n\r\nThe print size can be adjusted in the app if needed.

Just enter a keyword and leave it up to Live TV Player to do the rest. It will scour the web for M3U playlist files that match that keyword. Example keywords you can enter include \"Italy\", \"movies\", \"news\", \"sports\" or any keword that represents the type of television channels you want the app to create for you.\r\n\r\nShortly after, a message will pop up to let you know how many live TV streaming URLs it counted in the free M3U playlists it collected and give you an estimate of the processing time. Each live TV streaming URL is tested for validity.\r\n\r\nThe search can be configured by Country, Language and Depth. Depth represents the extent of the search. If a Depth 1 search does not generate enough channels, try a higher number. Be aware that even a Depth 1 search can take a long time but the estimate will be given in the pop-up message mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\n2) Do your own search\r\n\r\nUse Google from inside the app to target specific web pages with live TV streaming links. To find such web pages, enter the keywords \"extinf m3u8 free iptv\" followed by the keyword representing the type of television channels you want the app to create for you. Once a page is found, click 'Process site content'. Navigation is done using the Back and Forward buttons.\r\n\r\n3) Upload a file\r\n\r\nThis option is applicable if an M3U playlist file has already been saved in a location you can navigate to using Windows Explorer.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the search, all the valid live TV streaming links are converted into television channels that can be accessed through the Channel Selector dropdown underneath the Video Player.\r\n\r\nThe Video Player offers standard functionality. You can Rewind, Fast forward, Pause and Stop video, and vary its playback rate although this last feature does not work on all channels.\r\n\r\nThe next screen is the Channels Presentation and Management interface. You can edit channels individually by right-clicking and modifying the name. You can also select and delete channels.\r\n\r\nThe Export button lets you export the channel data into an M3U playlist file. Each of the live TV streaming links is valid because it was tested by Live TV Player, unless it expired during the time interval between generation and exporting.\r\n\r\nLive TV Player has a 24-hour trial period and then a price of $2.49.

of Duty®: Infinite Warfare delivers three unique game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies.\r\n\r\nCampaign is a return to the gritty, military roots of the franchise, while boldly looking ahead, delivering a rich and engaging narrative. Players play as Captain Reyes, a pilot turned Commander, who must lead the remaining coalition forces against a relentless enemy, while trying to overcome the deadly, extreme environments of space.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer combines a fluid momentum based movement system, player focused map design, deep customization, and a brand new combat system to create an intense gameplay experience where every second counts.\r\n\r\nZombies brings a fun, fresh take to Call of Duty zombies. Zombies in Spaceland will transport players back in time to a 1980’s amusement park complete with rides, an arcade, and a functioning rollercoaster. Embrace previously beloved aspects of the mode like easter eggs, power ups, and novel weapons while experiencing innovations like brand-new team mechanics, the After Life Arcade, and Fate and Fortune Cards.\r\n\r\nSupports Xbox Live features including earning achievements and sharing game clips.

(Nikon D-xxxx WITHOUT Snapbridge) *** A few Coolpix models and other Nikon compacts like Nikon 1 may also work. P900, D500 and crippled Snapbridge models do NOT work for sure. Use the one day free trial to test yours before buying.\r\n\r\nWirelessly download images you marked as \"Send to smart device\" on your WIFI (not Bluetooth) capable Nikon DSLR camera. Alternatively you can select the photos to download using a simple thumbnail overview. You can also remotely trigger the shutter release button, just like with an IR remote. Great for quickly sharing photos on the go via mobile, or for selfies.\r\nYou can also synchronize your Nikon cameras time from your device.\r\n\r\nPlease mention: it is fastest to select the images to download in your camera. The app just picks up the list you selected in the Nikons Wifi menu (see app web page or your cameras manual for details). The alternative selection by thumbnail in the app might show un-rotated thumbs with black border in some cameras. This is a Nikon problem.\r\nBulb mode is not supported.\r\n\r\nUse the one day free trial to test if the app is working fine with your camera. Most larger DSLRs will do, most smaller models will not be compatible, or not with all features. Please do no post bad review because your camera is not supported- I cannot support them. The trial app will not start after one day, which is not a bug.\r\n \r\nMake sure you updated your camera to the latest firmware. Also do not switch off your mobile while transferring (though nothing bad should happen).\r\nIf your camera is not supported, please do not issue bad reviews. It won't help, I cannot support more cameras because Nikon does not give me more technical information.\r\n\r\nThe app supports downloading your NEF raw files in maximum quality. You can edit them on the go with apps like Rawer or Fhotoroom.\r\n\r\nBuy once, and as a Windows 10 Universal App it will work across all your Windows 10 devices.\r\n\r\nThis app is NOT affiliated
