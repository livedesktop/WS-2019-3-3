It is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nMoney can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.\r\n\r\nPlay against the computer, against your friends in Local mode or with Thousands of Onopoly players around the world in Online Multiplayer Mode.\r\n\r\nYou can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play in Play with Friends Mode.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a simple game: you start off with some money, and your goal is to be the last player standing with money.

The British sent an expeditionary force to retake the islands. \r\n\r\nIn Submarine Patrol, you will relive this era as a leader of a submarine that patrols the islands and destroys enemy battleships.   \r\n\r\nTarget well before you shoot! Remember, you have a limited number of torpedoes on board. You cannot immediately fire one torpedo after another. \r\n\r\nIt takes 2-3 seconds to prepare the next torpedo. Injured ships, depending on the amount of damage, may reduce their speed and move slower. \r\n\r\nDepending on the ship type, you can hit it 1 to 4 times before it is completely destroyed. You have 10 levels to complete. If you do well you will be promoted to commander, captain, or even an admiral. The quality of shooting is determined by your score. You score with every successful shot and you are fined with every missed torpedo.  \r\n\r\nPlease, check our website for tips and tricks on the game here: http://pepper-games.com","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N41K5B65QJH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bike Race Free - Motorcycle Racing","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12178.13991835405022744.6034fcc4-ac91-4c47-8e83-32c7f86e86ca.b58cd2ed-58ca-4fab-82d3-7c1e92ec5e37","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40339.13991835405022744.6034fcc4-ac91-4c47-8e83-32c7f86e86ca.430dcc73-83e0-4465-b2b5-716f98f8ed16","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12178.13991835405022744.6034fcc4-ac91-4c47-8e83-32c7f86e86ca.b58cd2ed-58ca-4fab-82d3-7c1e92ec5e37","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"71","PackageFamilyNames":["42632InstaRoyalSportGames.BikeRaceFree-MotorcycleR_8gdk6ypn1p9yp"],"ContentIds":["89a1b3bc-d84b-f8b9-3090-3375a260cb1d","ebf6c15f-7287-3d84-cda0-c5f4ebdb0938"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Bike Race Free is Top Motorcycle Racing Game!

Happy retro gaming!\r\n\r\nCash Lines, The Fruit Machine can be played by touching the onscreen buttons or by using a mouse-which covers most devices so happy retro gaming, all you need to provide is some real luck...\r\n\r\nTo add coins/credits to the fruit machine simply tap or click the red coin slot (Found above the game board features). Each tap/click of the coin slot will add four credits to the fruit machine, then just play the fruit machine like you normally would do. Please note-the coin slot will become inactive if you have ninety six credits in the fruit machine or more-until some of those credits are used, then the coin slot will become active again. The coin slot will also become inactive if you have one hundred pounds or more in the bank of the fruit machine-once that bank has been collected the coin slot will become active again.\r\n\r\nThe main features of Cash Lines, The Fruit Machine include;\r\n\r\n-Mystery Bonus Features-(When the trail is on number four or number ten you can select a random mystery bonus feature which may help you to either get a prize win or increase the trail number you are currently on, depending on the feature and most of the time they are a real help to the player. The mystery bonus features available are-In no real order-Respin, Stoppa, Boost, Skill Stop, Selector, Numbers in View, Reel Skill, Number Run and Golden Hold).\r\n\r\n-Trial Nudges, Gamble and Shuffle-(When the trail is on numbers sixteen to twenty seven you will be offered nudges which you can gamble in an attempt to win more or shuffle the reels at the cost of one nudge). \r\n\r\n-Trail Auto Nudge-(When the trail number is on a nudge amount and there is a prize win available within that nudge amount for the reels you are on, you will be offered that prize win and an auto nudge to that prize win. The auto nudge will automatically offer the largest prize win available for the nudge amount and the reels you are on which is a real help to the player and ensures the player is offered the highest prize win possible for the circumstances and if collected, the auto nudge will also use the nudges and automatically nudge to the prize win offered).\r\n\r\n-Trial Jackpot Gold Run Repeater-(When the trail is on number twenty eight you will win the Jackpot and a random amount of steps on the Gold Run, which will repeat the Jackpot if you spin a successful Gold Run, so the more steps you have on the Gold Run, the more real the chance of a successful repeat).\r\n\r\n-Prize Win Gamble, Game Board Feature offer and Game Board Feature Shuffle-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine, you will be offered a prize win gamble, except in the case of Jackpot wins and you’ll be offered an exchange to a game board feature and you’ll be offered a game board feature shuffle. Here you can either gamble your prize win, take the game board feature offered or shuffle the game board feature where it’ll offer a new game board feature. You’ll be offered a free shuffle under certain circumstances and in conditions where there isn’t a free shuffle available and the shuffle is used it will reduce the prize win by one. The greater the prize win amount, the more real the chance you’ll be offered a better game board feature.\r\n\r\nThere are many more features like holds, trail held(s) and of course the Gold Run and the game board features themselves-which are too many to list and explain in detail but include prize win repeaters and features like Cash Flash along with the BIG features like the Jackpot Repeater, Mega Cash Repeater, Graphic Cash Repeater etc- for those lucky enough to be offered them.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDNC4R","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Free Cards Games","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10622.9007199266466396.ba2f267a-6ce9-4d26-b627-4bedfec0f5e7.5cba467e-9abc-4482-a03c-ea989888b47f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61468.9007199266466396.9d56dee6-ff28-44fa-94cd-8027b9fdb5b0.4959d4bb-734b-4285-8d43-d7d5bcd656e8","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"46","PackageFamilyNames":["12291raymond.li.FreeCardsGames_szs6zaftcmqhc"],"ContentIds":["c4971e7f-7c4a-16ae-c54a-3fc655cf83c4","30300fbc-b08e-85f2-7702-2c2cd33065e1","2976492c-4a28-0d82-c848-b782d24b4808"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Free Cards Games are solitaire games.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

There are three different variations of the game, BubbleWalk, PokerWalk and BingoWalk. You move along the road by walking in place, like a leisurely march. At the same time, you can do some playing tasks with either your right or left hand. In BubbleWalk you pop some bubbles as you walk along the road. Count how many bubbles you can pop. In PokerWalk, you are presented with ten cards along the road, you can pick five of them, you cannot change or return a card so try to choose wisely to get a good poker hand at the end of the road. If you have something on your hand, you can save the result, so if you want, you can try to collect different types of hands. In BingoWalk you control a magic beam with your hand. Find the five Bingo objects along your way, and aim your beam at the objects to collect them. But be careful, the objects will start to drift upwards as soon as you point your beam at them. If you get Bingo, you can save your time result.\r\n\r\nTYPE OF GAME\r\nThe Country Ramble Games are intended both as recreation and as a way to get exercise in a simple way. Note that these are not extreme action games. Country Ramble Games can be played by people with impaired mobility as well as people who want a little more than an ordinary walk, just level the step height button. The step height button determines how high you need to lift your feet or knees to get around. You can change the step height level to your preference. At the lowest setting it's easy to get around, this may be a good setting for elderly or people with some kind of mobility impairment. There are no time limits, if you feel like it, you can stop and rest outside the mediaeval chapel and listen to some hymns, you can turn down the game music volume and just listen to the birds, or why not pump up the step height level and turn the music volume up and get a really good exercise. Of course, you don't actually need to \"play\" anything if you don't want to, just walk and relax.\r\n\r\nWHO CAN PLAY\r\nThis game can be played by anyone who wants to take a leisurely walk or stroll in the countryside, one can even \"walk\" sitting down which makes it useful for elderly or for people with some form of mobility impairment. For those who want a more intense and difficult march, increasing the Step Height level will for sure make the pulse go up.\r\nThe games are simple in their design and will suit people also with less experience in computer gaming. The games are intentionally made to be cognitive non-demanding to suit people in need for relaxed activities. They may be a good choice for people with cognitive difficulties, such as in stress related fatigue syndrome where attention can be easily overwhelmed by stimuli, or for people with brain fatigue or minor dysfunctions caused by stroke. There are no \"bells and whistles\" in the games, at least very little, the scenes takes place in nature in a calm environment and the music consists of a mix of old folktunes (walking tunes), classical pieces with a somewhat modern arrangement. (Generally, \"Country Ramble Games\" were designed to be less stressful and less physically demanding than some common motion games.) The games has been developed with the support of psychological expertise. \r\nAs results can be saved and viewed in plotted graphs or in high score tables, the games could also be useful in a clinical context, such as in stroke rehabilitation and physiotherapy, since you can easily view progress in training. And the games can hopefully be a fun way of training a weak leg or arm. In such cases, discuss game playing with your medical advisor. For people suffering from problems with balance or mobility impairment such as weakness in legs, one can play sitting down.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\n•\tFree the space around you to not hurt yourself or to break any furniture. (Think about arms could be waving upwards too.)\r\n•\tIf children are playing they should be supervised and instructed by parents to not hurt themselves bumping into furniture.\r\n•\tIf other people are present in the room, make sure they are not in front of the camera and that they are at a safe distance from you bumping in to them.\r\n•\tIf you experience problem with balance, consider sitting down when playing.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL STUFF:\r\nBefore starting the game, Make sure you have the Kinect camera (sensor) properly installed on your computer. Follow instructions from Microsoft website to install Kinect and the necessary SDK software  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561 \r\nTo use Kinect for Xbox One on your computer, you need an adapter. After installation of Kinect you should have the Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0 installed in your app menu. \r\nFind a good spot to play where the Kinect camera can view you from head to feet. You can easily check this with the software that follows with the installation of the Kinect SDK software. You can for instance run Kinect Studio v2.0 (under Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0) to view yourself in front of the Kinect.\r\nIf everything looks ok, then you can start the Country Ramble Games.\r\nIt can be recommended to connect your computer to a larger monitor or TV screen (using a HDMI cable) to  improve the \"feel\" of the game and making it easier to see.\r\nTo make sure the game runs well on your system, you can download the free demo version before buying the full game. Download free demo (Country Ramble DEMO) at Windows Store or get more info at http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games\r\nQUICK START\r\nBefore you start, make sure Kinect is properly installed, see above under \"Technical stuff\"\r\n•\tStart the game by pressing the Country Ramble Games icon. \r\n•\tFrom the Main Menu (start screen), choose one of the three game variants and press one of the correspondent buttons underneath to play with either right or left hand. \r\n•\tStand in front of the Kinect camera, let the camera know you're there by moving slightly. When camera has found you, the blue screen layer will disappear.\r\n•\tWalk in place, that is, march on the spot, lifting your feet and knees a little. \r\n•\tMove either your right or left hand (depending on which hand you've chosen) to pop bubbles, pick cards or point beam at bingo items. \r\n•\tWhen you're done, you will be taken to the Orientation Board. From the Orientation Board Menu, you can either restart or choose one of the two other games. You choose either by putting your hand in one of the boxes or use the mouse to click.\r\n•\tIf you choose to go back to the Main Menu start screen, you can click on Result to view your result under any of the five player icons. (If you have saved any result.)\r\n\r\nPlaying the game variations:\r\n•\tBubbleWalk: As you walk, there will be bubbles appearing in front of you, sometimes shooting up way ahead of you, to reach them you will have keep a steady pace. Don't worry if you can't, as long as you walk and don't stand still, bubbles will keep appearing along the road. Try to pop the bubbles by reaching out at them with your hand.\r\n•\tPokerWalk: Ten cards will be placed along the road. try to get a poker hand by choosing wisely. When you're in reach to pick a card, a little sound can be heard. To pick a card, hold up your hand, a red lightbulb will show up around the card, keep holding your hand up for about 3 sec, and the card will show up in the panel at the bottom of the screen. Once you picked a card you cannot change it. If you don't want a card, just pass it. When you've picked five cards, you cannot pick any more card. The type of hands you can get (in order of value) is; one pair, two pairs, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush, and royal flush. If you get some of those hands and your cards are high you can also get bonus points added to the total sum. Both the type of hand and the total sum will be recorded if you choose to save your results.\r\n•\tBingoWalk: Five objects will show up on the panel at the bottom of the screen. As you walk along the road, try to spot those items (sometimes they are easy to see, sometimes not so easy). When you find them, point your magic beam towards them and they will start to float upwards. To catch the objects, hold your beam so it turns red, try to follow the object with your hand so the beam keeps being red for about 3 sec.  If you catch it, it will be checked in your panel. Tip; try to get close to the objects, at long distances or far to the sides, it can be hard to point and keep the beam steady enough. If you miss an object, you will get a second chance at the end.\r\n\r\nMORE INFO:\r\nDownload free Demo version at: http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games\r\nSee Video Tutorial on how to play on: https://youtu.be/SeVz1uzxqZg\r\nDownload PDF Tutorial for more in details on how to play at: http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NCFK5L65C1N","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spirits of Mystery: The Moon Crystal","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50540.13564809259941233.c75f3520-8d9b-46e5-ac19-17e8710c4970.9e485d97-d299-4c30-9fdd-3da9c8ef4d88","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58272.13564809259941233.c75f3520-8d9b-46e5-ac19-17e8710c4970.9c18936a-fb6b-44ea-91fb-aa817a5f6435","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54704.13564809259941233.c75f3520-8d9b-46e5-ac19-17e8710c4970.735d4892-a4c5-445d-9eb2-6fd2f1684fce","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33957.13564809259941233.a8c7eba4-783d-43e1-bf6c-b21b2ff3519c.37b4c16b-339c-452b-b603-e46b08a43cde","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£8.39","Price":8.39,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BigFishGames.SpiritsofMysteryTheMoonCrystal_bsrvrvej7yy2w"],"ContentIds":["eed56271-cd71-ee4f-8604-a7fb3b23ea6f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"AMAX Interactive proudly presents the next adventure in the enchanting Spirits of Mystery series! \r\n\r\nHappy birthday, Princess!

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MWN64Q712VD","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Wenjia Complete Edition","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10678.13840589489345583.9cbcdb83-298e-4af5-8dd1-725050aca170.97f7c5b6-6e20-44e3-9e0d-554a9ee07c08","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6134.13840589489345583.9cbcdb83-298e-4af5-8dd1-725050aca170.826180e1-72ad-4482-841c-f993ed2d0187","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34504.13840589489345583.9cbcdb83-298e-4af5-8dd1-725050aca170.bba4d684-20a9-499a-906a-519c035995e7","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£8.39⁺","Price":8.39,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":[""],"ContentIds":[],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Wenjia Complete Edition includes everything we want to deliver to our beloved users, get it now and enjoy the journey!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PFNTR1J02N4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fire Engine Simulator","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38577.14197086091237091.673322a6-342d-418a-8957-237c22fb5b3e.e670b96e-2bc8-41f2-9cab-6fdd5aeb9663","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17184.14197086091237091.e24788d5-1d15-4f43-905f-cf41a671ebf4.6fe501cc-4d36-405a-9fe9-fde80b625c0c","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.9,"RatingsCount":"13","PackageFamilyNames":["SkisoSoft.FireEngineSimulator_bdkna9a3jrn5p"],"ContentIds":["31abcdce-38c2-3beb-6ce7-ac07323b2cfc","7456dc7c-dc0c-e369-6ae8-e328dba475f2"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FES: Fire Engine Simulator\r\n\r\nFire trucks are waiting for you.

They understood, much better than any other people at that time - the art of economics. From their trading centers in the Baltic Sea, Birka and Haithabu they sailed the seas and developed extensive trade routes from Russia to the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe game considers all aspects of Vikingism in a fantastic and realistic 3D world - trade, economics, and combat to a degree that may have been in the real life of a Viking.\r\n\r\nGoal is to build a robust economic system with a flourishing maritime trade under realistic climatic and seasonal conditions. Only with the income of your island production, the merchandising and the reward of fullfilled tasks - you’re able to fulfill the claims of your lord - Thorvaldson.\r\nBut apart from the harsh climate and other bad circumstances, the multitude of enemies are the biggest threat to your prosperity and your life. As a loyal swordsman of Thorvaldson, you will receive guard troops and can protect your village with massive weapons. Protection that you need to defend you properties and inhabitants.\r\n\r\nOther information about the game:\r\nThe presentation of the figures, the calendar and the seasons, are largely based on historical traditions and geographical conditions. At the presentation of battle scenes, however, in order to increase the thrill, we have used a little bit of fantasy.\r\nThe in-game time of the game is divided so that 1 hour of real time means a day in-game.

Dogs are the most devoted friends. You can teach your cute puppy different commands. You can play ball, travel, and just take care of it. Dogs also have a great nose and are the best detectives! In exchange for their service, each dog dreams about a tasty bone! In this coloring book, you will find exciting scenes from the life of dogs of various breeds.\n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG1R3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Motorbike","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30081.9007199266304014.4d8fe372-5165-4d9b-a003-e9b0443a2ea0.c48fa3c9-9ad4-48b8-9bfc-0a26dcd4dd6e","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51090.9007199266304014.0c8e90ac-fc3d-4dad-9f49-293b775f44c2.5833e561-e88b-4b81-b179-4ec4ce9695c8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£4.19","Price":4.19,"AverageRating":3.3,"RatingsCount":"7","PackageFamilyNames":["baKnoGames.Motorbike_eeph92kqn0y8r"],"ContentIds":["695751d2-6eee-bf8c-f105-3122d7c31c3a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A casual bike skills game full of action and real physics dynamics. \r\n\r\nMotorbike comes with 100 original tracks, thousands of online tracks and a track editor to create your own tracks and share with other players.\r\n\r\nSelect from different riders, bikes and landscapes.

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child’s developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThe educational flashcards for kids are divided into the following categories: “Cars and Transport”, “Professions”, “Buildings”, “Musical Instruments”, “Tools”, “Furniture”, “Kitchen Tools” and “Clothing and shoes”. \r\n\r\nOne important distinction makes this educational app stand out from the rest: instead of drawings, which are not always easy to identify as a real object, the child will see bright, beautiful and fun-spirited photographs. This will allow the child to “see” each object as it actually appears in the real world, while allowing the parent to tell the child more about this object.\r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! In addition to English, this app also supports the Spanish, German and many other languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with the educational flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their teachers and classmates. An A+ is guaranteed!\r\n\r\nThe youngster does not need to be able to read in order to use this educational app. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently. \r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJJJG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Medical Center - Hidden Object Games","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.893.9007199266266425.b4533816-8713-47e3-967e-b384ad439769.2627174a-931a-4bb3-a249-4831dcdfe7e5","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9000.9007199266266425.4cc1aa7a-6dc9-4bb3-a800-ac9b24adf096.58073326-b505-47db-973f-8475751a244b","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.69","Price":1.69,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BlueArtStudios.MedicalCenter-HiddenObjectGames_7w153hasn3z84"],"ContentIds":["a0490ce6-3365-82c1-0d67-a462b2742e64"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"PlayHOG presents Medical Center, a Hidden Object game where we have carefully hidden 40 objects per level in a total of 10 levels to give you 400 objects to find. \r\n\r\nFind hidden objects in this Medical Center.\r\n\r\nEach level has 10 independent achievements to unlock.

On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.\r\n\r\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit, the goal being, of course, to finish all suits, at which time the player would have won. There are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck:\r\n\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste, either allowing three passes through the deck or placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once, reversing the order of each group of three as the cards are dealt.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but only passing through the deck once.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste with no limit on passes through the deck, but allowing the player to switch once to a single pass through the deck one card at a time; after that single pass, however, the player cannot go back to turning three cards at a time and can turn over no more cards from the waste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NMMR8V2LQ80","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fire Balls 3D!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13572.13689355270361215.ff1e4192-c09b-4e84-8505-1d49daff1a40.caaaaa95-e4eb-4c3f-ac7f-404d9f48b2d7","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24070.13689355270361215.ff1e4192-c09b-4e84-8505-1d49daff1a40.a6558439-afbe-4cf9-9bd7-27526002b970","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":2.4,"RatingsCount":"9","PackageFamilyNames":["44511HappyDragonInc.FireBalls3D_ffz6r8qf25722"],"ContentIds":["ea989423-771b-1d2d-4009-c931da2ebef6","e900a728-bb8d-2dbc-afd8-45b936eaea70"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Fire Balls 3D is a single-tap hyper casual game that will keep you hooked for hours!\r\n\r\nHold to make your dot fire forward, and be careful from moving obstacles.\r\n\r\nThe game features unlimited levels and 20 beautiful color themes.\r\n\r\nFire balls 3D is hyper causal game with beautiful stack tower style game that hooked for hours. shoot the ball cannon to the tower stack.

The Tetris game was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984—the product of Alexey’s computer programming experience and his love of puzzles. In the decades to follow, Tetris became one of the most successful and recognizable  games, appearing on nearly every gaming platform available. This App is based on the classic Tetris, a new development in windows10!\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nThe goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling Tetriminos inside the Matrix (playing field). Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.\r\n\r\nAs lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging. If the Blocks land above the top of the playing field, the game is over.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDNB1Z","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"123 Free Solitaire","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43373.9007199266467332.42ac8c7f-90bd-4dd8-b323-09bb7b6e103e.8c438531-42af-4d99-9ce9-2782390a9db8","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16827.9007199266467332.fe9c6240-7e34-4803-bccf-758798cb0794.f971d1db-bab4-4b44-88be-b0931ed3e566","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26223.9007199266467332.3615661e-8749-4cff-8783-597b37919acb.044ab039-793a-41b0-98bf-7cc68de8a235","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45660.9007199266467332.7db09c5d-84b0-42d4-9539-c3becbb2c496.5cdf66ea-79d5-4f08-a250-5f757b632c0f","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44771.9007199266467332.1aeded92-5a3b-457b-a1cb-6b630c7c5dae.41fec3ee-dd00-45f8-a46a-5a84446a0577","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57183.9007199266467332.6cbee0fd-bfee-4222-b358-2147b031d025.3464a4e1-c0ff-48a2-bc8a-254384b64e85","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62581.9007199266467332.49732159-fd5e-4d1a-b1c5-4d9907999e57.a39e9d60-9d16-47ab-892b-17fff6c339fc","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23137.9007199266467332.7f221449-fb50-4b8e-93ec-0062caceef9b.056d5314-51f2-4d0b-8c9b-73218fecf699","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61338.9007199266467332.7f221449-fb50-4b8e-93ec-0062caceef9b.2c0aad89-5336-4534-bc04-51780fec1e5f","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7212.9007199266467332.7f221449-fb50-4b8e-93ec-0062caceef9b.46c63a9d-f615-4d90-af28-6f5acf5160c8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.8,"RatingsCount":"23","PackageFamilyNames":["TreeCardGames.123FreeSolitaire_n666hb6ddc5jp"],"ContentIds":["41933c6b-7e53-f421-076e-6bba4f106e18","1ac3a72d-239c-cb6d-06a0-a84337eb2fe7"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"123 Free Solitaire is the Microsoft Store version of the award-winning solitaire card game with millions of downloads since 1998.

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDJZ74","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Real Chess Online","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41487.9007199266508173.847716f8-90b2-401e-b185-7413e4fab68f.bc578161-1db3-4082-a641-9b629aa3792b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7131.9007199266508173.fe8c076c-9ab0-41ff-91e4-e04ce8c5eb45.f496af07-fcb9-4d45-8275-e40e114af9de","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37521.9007199266508173.95a89991-f346-4d51-9191-49ff2b8fccf1.410b819d-31c0-4c3d-b615-914644d2e98d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.9,"RatingsCount":"43","PackageFamilyNames":["52833Alienforce.ChessFusionFree_np5hvx4gj677g"],"ContentIds":["d0245d76-9598-bf3d-ca51-d3a9c84401e0","2a8109dd-f4bb-1db6-75a9-1d977887f6b1","de49797c-b35b-c745-4a01-d2d8270d7231"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This app brings classic chess game into new dimension.
